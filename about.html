        <h1>About MBTI Relationship Analyzer</h1>
        <p>This website is designed to provide a fun and interesting way to explore the potential dynamics between different MBTI types in various relationships.</p>
        <p>Our goal is to help users understand that relationship compatibility is not about "good" or "bad" personality types, but rather about understanding and appreciating the differences in how people perceive the world and interact with each other.</p>
        <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>The analysis provided by this tool is for entertainment purposes only and should not be taken as professional psychological advice. MBTI is a tool for self-understanding, and the interpretations on this site are generalized to provide a broad perspective.</p>
